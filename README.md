# Description
Getting tired of your youtube playlist having multiple videos that are unavailable (ex. privated videos, deleted videos, restricted video in your country)?

Youtube's tools for playlists are horrendous, you can't even see all the unavailable videos in your list so you can replace it. Sometimes a video looks normal in the playlist but if you opened it, it'll show it's unavailable

I have alot of videos in YT playlist because I use youtube for my music. Every other week, some music gets suddenly unavailable. So I made an app to replace the missing videos.

This app checks every video in your playlist for videos that are restricted in your region, privated by the uploader, deleted because of copyright.

It uses the Youtube API v3 and you need to login to the youtube account that owns the playlist

It then displays the video title, url link (so you can search it in the google or in waybackmachine to know the original title), and the video ID for the playlist (important for removing a video in a playlist)

I also added a way to remove a video from a playlist using the 'video ID' provided
